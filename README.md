## ðŸ“ƒ Description

Â Â Â Â Countdown App is an identical copy of the app shown in the [Countdown Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10039344/). It's a simple date generator with a countdown timer and a couple of scary notifications and sounds, the app was made with [React-Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).

## ðŸ“… Date Generation

Â Â Â Â The *"death date"* is generated based on the device HardwareID, the reason for that is to prevent a different date from being generated if the user reinstall or deletes the application data.

## ðŸš€ Motivation

- Making an exact copy of the movie application and and post it on Google Play.

- Studying local only notifications and how to trigger sound when app is on background.

- Improving my knowledge in React-Native while building a responsive frontend design.
